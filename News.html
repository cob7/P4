     <h1>Microsoft acquires Activsion Blizzard</h1>
	<p class="text-center"> Microsoft will acquire Activision Blizzard for $95.00 per share, in an all-cash transaction valued at $68.7 billion, inclusive of Activision Blizzard’s net cash. When the transaction closes, Microsoft will become the world’s third-largest gaming company by revenue, behind Tencent and Sony. The planned acquisition includes iconic franchises from the Activision, Blizzard and King studios like “Warcraft,” “Diablo,” “Overwatch,” “Call of Duty” and “Candy Crush,” in addition to global eSports activities through Major League Gaming. The company has studios around the world with nearly 10,000 employees.

Bobby Kotick will continue to serve as CEO of Activision Blizzard, and he and his team will maintain their focus on driving efforts to further strengthen the company’s culture and accelerate business growth. Once the deal closes, the Activision Blizzard business will report to Phil Spencer, CEO, Microsoft Gaming.</p>

    <h1>Finally, PlayStation is taking retro gaming seriously</h1>
	<p class="text-center">A Tweet from PlayStation senior build engineer Garrett Fredley has got the internet buzzing. The game developer revealed he has begun a new job at a new Game Preservation division inside PlayStation; Tweeting he has begun "working as one of their initial hires for the newly created Preservation team!"

It appears Sony is finally getting serious about preserving its fantastic back catalogue of PlayStation games. For years Sony's approach to game preservation has been lacklustre. In 2018 Sony did release the PlayStation Classic Console, as found in our best retro gaming consoles guide, but this was met with muted reviews due to some poor emulation and a mixed games list. 

News of an actual Game Preservation division inside Sony PlayStation is welcome. It looks like Sony is finally taking its heritage seriously, and making steps to safeguard its classic games and their design. This could mean classics such as Vib Ribbon (below) that turned your music, played from PlayStation's CD drive, into a game level, could finally officially resurface properly.   </p>

      <h1>Red Dead Online Leak Suggests New Feature Could Be Coming to the Game</h1>
    <p class="text-center">Fans of Red Dead Redemption 2's online multiplayer aspect Red Dead Online have been frustrated with developer Rockstar for some time now. Players see Rockstar's continued support of Grand Theft Auto Online and wonder why it has seemingly stopped putting out new content for Red Dead Online. They haven't given up hope yet, however. And according to a new leak, their continued push for further updates may be rewarded.

Red Dead Online recently received a small, disappointing update that was said to improve the security of the multiplayer game. While the update itself was nothing worth mentioning, dataminers were able to discover some interesting changes within Red Dead Online's files. The reference refers to "rustling_owner_dead" and a string of text that reads "This ranch has been abandoned by its owners. Come back later." Obviously, that's not a persuasive piece of evidence regarding a future content update, but it's enough to stir up some speculation.  </p>
